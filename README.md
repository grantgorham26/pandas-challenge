# pandas-challenge #

In this project we were taking mock school data and analyzing it to help make future decision on budgeting and priority for the district. The first analysis I completed was summarizing districts data. Through this analysis I calculated the unique number of schools, total student population, and total budget. For test scores I calculated avergae test scores for both math and reading as well as the amount of students who were passing math, reading and both combined. After calculating thsese I combined all the new data into a new combined dataframe. I used https://www.dataquest.io/blog/pandas-cheat-sheet/ to help write the code for students who were passing the standardized tests. After analyzing the districts I analyzed the each schools specific data. This analysis started by separating the school into their types, the number of students at each school and the budget per student at each school. Next I calculated the averages test scores of each school I used https://www.statology.org/pandas-mean-by-group/ to help produce this code. Next I calculated the number of schools that were passing each tests and both test combined. I used https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40710811/count-items-greater-than-a-value-in-pandas-groupby, https://www.dataquest.io/blog/pandas-cheat-sheet/ and some of the starter code to help write this portion. Once these were calculated i combined them all into a new dataframe.
