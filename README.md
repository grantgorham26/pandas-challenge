# pandas-challenge #

In this project we were taking mock school data and analyzing it to help make future decision on budgeting and priority for the district using pandas. The first analysis I completed was summarizing districts data. Through this analysis I calculated the unique number of schools, total student population, and total budget. For test scores I calculated avergae test scores for both math and reading as well as the amount of students who were passing math, reading and both combined. After calculating thsese I combined all the new data into a new combined dataframe using the concat function. I used https://www.dataquest.io/blog/pandas-cheat-sheet/ to help write the code for students who were passing the standardized tests. After analyzing the districts I analyzed the each schools specific data. This analysis started by separating the school into their types, the number of students at each school and the budget per student at each school. Next I calculated the averages test scores of each school I used https://www.statology.org/pandas-mean-by-group/ to help produce this code. Next I calculated the number of schools that were passing each tests and both test combined. I used https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40710811/count-items-greater-than-a-value-in-pandas-groupby, https://www.dataquest.io/blog/pandas-cheat-sheet/ and some of the starter code to help write this portion. Once these were calculated I combined them all into a new dataframe. To combine them into a new dataframe I had help from Marc Karam a TA. Once this new dataframe was created I further analyzed it to calculate the highest and lowest performing schools and put them in a dataframe. After this I grouped the data by grade and calculated the average test scores and the percentage of students passing each standardized test. Then the schools were grouped by size, spending and type using the pandas cut function. The average test scores and percentage passing each standardized test was calculated for each of these categories and a new dataframe was created.

## Analysis

* When comparing the size of school and their test scores, the smaller and medium schools have far better test scores in all categories compared to the large schools. This is could be due to a better teacher to student ratio. 
* When comparing the spedning per student to performance on test, the lower the budget per student the higher the test scores are in all categories.

* The data that was analyzed consisted of 15 different high schools that had a varying ranges of student body. There was two type of schools: Charter and District. Each school consisted of 4 grades and each grade takes both a reading and math test. Every shool had a varying budget.
